I am trying to learn the discipline of productivity.  Confession time, I am the
King of Procrastination.  Getting distracted and losing focus is one of my 
biggest problems.  Just read a story of a guy named Richard who grew a huge
computer networking company.  This is related in the Emotional Intelligence 
Quickbook.  One of the most important thing he learned how to do was to stay
focused and work through problems.  He got better and better at solving problems
by "training his brain", and thus found it easier and easier to stay on track.
This is the challenge.  Work in blocks of time long enough to practice sustained
focus.  And stay focused.

Go to the ant, O sluggard.  Consider her ways and be wise.
