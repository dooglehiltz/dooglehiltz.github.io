Many people discribe their move from a liberal/progressive mindset to conservatism/libertarianism as being red-pilled.  
What a trip it is to realize for the first time the government actions usually make things worse not better.  Give people welfare
and they become dependent on the state.  Unemployment rates rise with unemployment insurance because you are paying people to not work. 
The "safety net" rather than breaking your fall, is a prison and keeps you down.

The red pill process can be quite rapid for some but for me it was a slow as I tried to integrate the full implications of the non-agression
principle with my christian/conservative views.  

Probably the first step for me was reading the National Post, a conservative Canadian publication.  There is a wide range of opions 
allowed but for the most part the skepticism of government I find in those pages is very refreshing.  The first step for me was the 
opinion pages.  There are two of them.  One is for general political topics and the other is in the Financial Post section, dealing 
mostly with economic issues, there is however overlap in the two sections.

Just a disclaimer however, if you are a hard libertarian or anarcho-capitalist you might yell at some of the opions.

Terence Corcoran the financial pages editor is great as well as Lawrence Solomon, the latter being perhaps the closest to 
being a Libertarian.

Check out these writers for a start and check back with me in a week or two for your next dose...
