Many people describe their move from a liberal/progressive mindset to conservatism/libertarianism as being red-pilled.  
What a trip it is to realize for the first time that government actions usually make things worse not better.  Give people welfare
and they become dependent on the state.  Unemployment rates rise with unemployment insurance because you are paying people to not work. 
The "safety net" rather than breaking your fall, is a prison that keeps you down.

The red pill process can be quite rapid for some but for me it was a slow as I tried to integrate the full implications of the non-agression
principle with my christian/conservative views.  

Probably the first step for me was reading the National Post.  The Post hosts a wide range of opions 
but you will find more skepticism of government in its pages than any other major Canadian new publication.  The first pill for me was the 
opinion pages.  The [Full Comment](http://nationalpost.com/category/opinion) section is for general political topics and [FP Comment](http://business.financialpost.com/category/opinion) is in the Financial Post section, dealing 
mostly with economic issues, there is however overlap in the two sections.

Just a disclaimer however, if you are a hard libertarian or anarcho-capitalist you might yell at some of the opions.

Terence Corcoran the financial pages editor is great as well as Lawrence Solomon, the latter being perhaps the closest to 
being a Libertarian.

Check out these writers for a start and check back with me in a week or two for your next dose...
