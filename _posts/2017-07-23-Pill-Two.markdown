If I want to red pill someone there are more direct ways than I am suggesting in
these posts.  The websites and individuals I am suggesting are roughly the path
I took down the Libertarian rabbit hole.  Taking a gradual approach may be
better than risking "turning someone off" by sudden exposure to the most radical
writers.

I have no recollection of the name of the article but I do remember that Terence
Corcoran mentioned [Dan Mitchell](https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/) of the
[Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/).  Dan quickly became one of my favorite
writers and is especially good on podcasts and youtube.  Great article on his
site about [bone-headed](https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2017/07/23/great-moments-in-foreign-government-6/)
government moves.  Cato is a Libertarian site which takes some flack for its
association with the [Koch brothers](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-kochs-v-cato-winners-and-losers)
but they have in recent past become independent of the billionaire brothers.

Cato puts out a lot of good material, plenty for the new libertarian to chew on.
If you like the above material, just wait.  There is plenty more to come.  Stay
tuned!
