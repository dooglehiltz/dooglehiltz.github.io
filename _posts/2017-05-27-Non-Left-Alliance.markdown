The great divide in politics seems to be between the left/progressives and and
all stripes of people who want to be left alone.  Everyone from Libertarians to
the alt-right should see this clearly.  The left wants to destroy and control us
so our alliance should last until they are abolished.  We need to do the hard
work of educating people that what the government gives in return for what it
gets is far worse than getting nothing in return.  As Stefan said in a recent
podcast, it is soul destroying to be dependent on the government.  They want to
own you.
