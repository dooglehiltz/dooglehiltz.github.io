Taking the Red Pill can be quite disorienting as your world view changes and the
ground seems to shift under your feet.  Things that were once sacred become
profane.

A number of years ago I was in the local public library and I came
across [The Real Lincoln](http://store.mises.org/Real-Lincoln-The-P172.aspx)by
Thomas DiLorenzo.  I had been trying to find out more about the American Civil
War and this title seemed interesting.  But Whoa!  The synopsis was saying some
less than flattering things about Saint Lincoln.  How can this be that the man
who ended slavery was anything other than a great guy?  Well you have to read
the book!  Or if you don't have the time or inclination a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbFty9nZUac)
will have to suffice!
