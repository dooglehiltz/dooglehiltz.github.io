Taking the Red Pill can be quite disorienting as your world view changes and the
ground seems to shift under your feet.  Things that were once sacred become
profane.

A number of years ago I was in the local public library and I came
across [The Real Lincoln](http://store.mises.org/Real-Lincoln-The-P172.aspx) by
[Thomas DiLorenzo](https://mises.org/profile/thomas-j-dilorenzo).  I was curious
about the American Civil War and this title seemed interesting.  But Whoa!  The
synopsis was saying some less than flattering things about Saint Lincoln.  How
can it be that the man who ended slavery was anything other than a great guy?
Well you have to read the book!  Or if you don't have the time or inclination a
[you tube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbFty9nZUac) will have to
suffice!

Not a minor footnote to this story is my discovery of the
[Mises Institute](https://mises.org/).  In the last post I had mentioned the
[Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/) which does great work but find the Mises
Institute to be more hardcore Libertarian.
