Years ago when I was just entering the workforce, I wondered why did I, even
though I had not yet cast a vote, have thousands of dollars of debt hanging over
my head from at least two levels of government.  My political philosophy has
morphing over the years till know where my politics could be described as
[Libertarian](https://infogalactic.com/info/Libertarianism) and my economic
views as [Austrian](https://mises.org/about-mises/what-austrian-economics).

I am running a parallel site to this one at a [blogger site](https://grandlibertariantheory.blogspot.ca/).
If you want to leave comments there you can.  This is part of a larger project
for me to develop coding skills.
